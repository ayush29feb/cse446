    Inputs
    ------
    X is an NxD matrix of inputs.
    y is a Dx1 vector of labels.
    n_starts says how many times to randomly re-initialize k-means. You don't
        need to change this.

    Outputs
    -------
    The output is a dictionary with the following fields:
    Mu is a kxD matrix of cluster centroids
    z is an Nx1 vector assigning points to clusters. So, for instance, if z[4] =
        2, then the algorithm has assigned the 4th data point to the second
